{"name":"Angular 2 Starter","tagline":"Simple Angular 2 Starter for TypeScript with Gulp, Bower, Karma, Jasmine using SystemJS","body":"# Angular 2 Starter\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/antonybudianto/angular2-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/antonybudianto/angular2-starter)\r\n\r\n> Angular 2 is still in Beta stage, please **don't** use this in production   \r\n> Follow it [here](https://splintercode.github.io/is-angular-2-ready/)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nFirstly, you need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (support Node from 0.12.x or higher), then   \r\ninstall these packages globally:   \r\n```bash\r\nnpm install -g gulp bower\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, just run:\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\nand to install bower dependencies:\r\n```bash\r\nbower install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Start\r\nLet's start up the server, run:   \r\n`gulp` or `gulp serve-dev`\r\n\r\nand done! The browser will popup and you can start trying Angular 2!   \r\nEvery changes to the file will refresh the browser automatically\r\nand it'll also compile your changed TypeScripts files to Javascript files.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThis starter comes with unit-testing gulp workflow, using:   \r\n- [Karma](karma-runner.github.io) as test-runner\r\n- [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) as the testing framework\r\n- [Istanbul](https://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/) as coverage instrumenter\r\n- [Remap Istanbul](https://github.com/SitePen/remap-istanbul) for remap JS coverage to TS using sourcemaps.   \r\n\r\nJust run:   \r\n```bash\r\ngulp test\r\n```\r\nand it'll compile needed TS files (app and test-helpers), start Karma, then remap Istanbul coverage so that it shows TypeScripts coverage, not the transpiled Javascript coverage.\r\n![Coverage result](http://s9.postimg.org/ij32cv5dr/test.png)\r\n> Thanks to Julie Ralph's [ng2-test-seed](https://github.com/juliemr/ng2-test-seed) which helped me lot to get started.\r\n   \r\n\r\n## Production\r\n> Angular 2 is not ready for *production* yet, consider this build task for learning purpose\r\n\r\nYou can create production build by running:\r\n```bash\r\ngulp build-sjs\r\n```\r\nor you can serve the build folder by running:\r\n```bash\r\ngulp serve-build\r\n```\r\nIt uses [SystemJS Builder](https://github.com/systemjs/builder) to bundle your application so it's ready for production use\r\n\r\n## License\r\nMIT\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
