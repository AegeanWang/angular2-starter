# Angular 2 Starter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/antonybudianto/angular2-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/antonybudianto/angular2-starter)

> Angular 2 is still in Alpha stage, please don't use this in production

### Installation
You need these:
- Node with npm
- Bower
- Gulp

after you have them, just run:
```
npm install
```
It will also run `bower install` after the npm install done   


### Start
Let's start up the server
```
gulp
```
or
```
gulp serve-dev
```

and done! The browser will popup and you can start trying Angular 2!   
Every changes to the file will refresh the browser automatically
and it'll also compile your changed TypeScripts files to Javascript files.
